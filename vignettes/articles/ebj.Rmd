@appel2012 explore the relationship between post-conflict net FDI inflows and states' implementation of post-conflict justice (PCJ) institutions. They find that these institutions promote foreign investment in post-conflict states.

You can access their data directly using:

```{r}
head(ebj)
```

You can then use these data to replicate their full model:

```{r}
m <- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + gdp_per_capita + gdp + gdp_per_capita_growth + cap_account_openness + ex_rate_fluc + labor + f_life_exp + pol_constraints + polity2 + damage + conflict_duration + peace_agreement + victory, 
        data = ebj)

modelsummary(m, stars = T)
```
